# Meta-Pipeline
## A Galaxy workflow to do taxonomical classification.

Welcome to Meta-Pipeline!

Metagenomics has been increasingly becoming very important in studies of human and animal health. It has become clear that bacteria in and on our bodies are very signifcant. Thus there is a big boost in science society who are willling to study metagenomics. When we want to do downstream analysis in our microbial community, the first step is to find out about our community, what the community ultimately looks like. My idea is that compiling the state of the art tools (such as Kraken2, Centrifuge and CLARK) and create a single pipeline that will produce a visualized output file for each tool so the user can compare.
